# `auto-header-ids` README

This VSCode extension automatically adds an `id` attribute to HTML header elements in the current document.

## Features

By default, this extension adds `id` attributes to `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements. It processes the header text to generate a unique, URL-friendly ID.

The ID value is generated by converting the header text to lowercase, replacing spaces and HTML entities (like `&nbsp;`) with hyphens, removing special characters, and truncating the result to a maximum of 15 characters to keep it concise. If a generated ID is not unique, a counter is appended to ensure uniqueness (e.g., `section-1`, `section-2`).

To run the command, open the **Command Palette** (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `"Auto Header IDs: Add IDs to Headers"`.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings, which you can modify in your VS Code `settings.json` file:

- `auto-header-ids.headersToProcess`: An array of strings that specifies which header elements should have IDs added.

  **Example:**
  To add IDs to only `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags, you would add the following to your `settings.json`:

  ```json
  "auto-header-ids.headersToProcess": ["2", "3"]
  ```

  The default value is `["1", "2"]`.
