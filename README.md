# `auto-header-ids` README

This VSCode extension automatically adds an `id` attribute to HTML header elements in the current document.

## Features

By default, this extension adds `id` attributes to `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements. It processes the header text to generate a unique, URL-friendly ID.

The ID value is generated by converting the header text to lowercase, replacing spaces and HTML entities (like `&nbsp;`) with hyphens, removing special characters, and truncating the result to a maximum of 15 characters to keep it concise. If a generated ID is not unique, a counter is appended to ensure uniqueness (e.g., `section-1`, `section-2`).

To run the command, open the **Command Palette** (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `"Auto Header IDs: Add IDs to Headers"`.
